In order to try out this example first start the server in XCode, which should bring up a window with an imageview. After that either compile the flash files with sprouts (http://projectsprouts.org/), mxmlc or just open the BitmapTransfer-debug.swf. You should now see the sprouts bitmap in the cocoa window and some logging output in both applications (have a look at flashlog.txt).
